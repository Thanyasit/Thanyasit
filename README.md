I am a mechatronics engineer but you can call me Game. I am excited to introduce myself and share my passion for technology and innovation. I was born in Bangkok, Thailand and have always been fascinated by the world of computer games. This interest led me to explore software programs and how they could be used to optimize performance.

As I pursued my studies in electronics, I discovered the fascinating world of Embedded systems. I was captivated by the idea of small devices that could automate everything and make our lives easier. I enjoyed the challenge of creating programs to perform specific tasks and bring new ideas to life.

Along the way, I realized that mechanisms have similar principles to software programs, but they are faster and more accurate because they are hardware-based and can be sensed. This realization led me to explore the world of robotics, and I became determined to create an amazing creation by combining software programs and mechanisms - a robot.

As I continued to learn more about technology, I discovered the perfect blend of these three elements in Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has the power to create complete projects that can automate a wide range of tasks and improve our lives in countless ways.

Throughout my journey of learning to code, each project I undertook was a stepping stone towards my ultimate goal of becoming a proficient programmer. Starting with the low-level Assembly language, I slowly built up my knowledge and skills by learning higher-level languages like C, C++, and MATLAB. As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I discovered the power of Python and the vast array of applications it offers.

In my pursuit of knowledge, I also learned web development languages such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, which allowed me to create interactive and engaging websites. Through each project, I encountered challenges that tested my problem-solving skills and helped me grow as a programmer.

As I continue to learn and expand my skill set, I look forward to tackling new and exciting projects that challenge me to push my limits as a programmer.

<h4>Work hard</h4>
I am someone who strives to work hard in everything I do. I believe that hard work is the key to success, and I am constantly pushing myself to improve and achieve my goals. I understand that success doesn't come easy, and that it requires dedication, discipline, and a willingness to put in the effort. I am not afraid of hard work, and I am always willing to go the extra mile to achieve my objectives.

<h4>Self-learner</h4>
I am a self-learner, constantly seeking new knowledge and skills to improve myself. Through various resources such as online courses, books, and tutorials, I am able to expand my knowledge and develop new competencies. Self-learning has allowed me to take control of my own education and pursue my interests and passions on my own terms. I believe that continuous self-learning is essential in a rapidly changing world, and I am committed to developing and refining my skills through this process.<br><br>
<b>**Here, I will display skills specifically for programmers.</b>
